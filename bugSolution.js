The problem is likely due to inconsistencies within the Android build environment or cached build artifacts.  The solution involves a series of steps to clean the environment and rebuild the app:

1. **Clean the project:**  `expo prebuild --clean`
2. **Clear the Expo cache:** Delete the `.expo` and `node_modules` directories. 
3. **Clear Gradle Cache:** Delete the Gradle cache directory (location varies depending on OS). 
4. **Invalidate caches (Android Studio):** If using Android Studio, invalidate caches/restart.
5. **Rebuild the app:** `expo build:android`

If the problem persists, ensure all dependencies are up-to-date, and carefully review the full error message from the Expo CLI build process for more clues.
