This repository demonstrates a bug encountered during the Android build process using the Expo CLI.  The build fails with an unclear error message concerning resource linking.  The `bug.js` file shows example code that might trigger the issue (though the exact cause is not fully understood). The solution, described in `bugSolution.js`, focuses on steps to clean the build environment and other potential workarounds.
